# COMP 587 Project Proposal
## Contributor Names: Jonathan Chua & Chris Wheeler

### Links to SUT Source Code
- [Movie Application](https://github.com/chizuo/COMP587-Project-App)
- [RESTful API as database abstraction layer]()
- [Database Stored Procedures]()

### SUT Size
- Movie Application: *TBD*
- RESTful API web service: *TBD*
- Database Stored Procedures: *TBD*

### State of SUT
The SUT is currently in the software requirements phase. 
The software system will be developed upon approval of the proposal.

### Attributes
1. Attribute 1
2. Attribute 2
3. Attribute 3
4. Attribute 4

### Components
1. Component 1
2. Component 2
3. Component 3
4. Component 4 

### Capabilities
1. *TBD*

### Capabilities Count
| Component | Attribute 1 | Attribute 2 | Attribute 3 | Attribute 4 |
|-----------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Component 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Component 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Component 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Component 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Basic Testing
Unit tests to validate component capabilities are according to spec.
Integration tests to validate the correctness and performance of each software.

### Advanced Verification & Validation
End to End testing the complete software system to mimic real-world use cases.
